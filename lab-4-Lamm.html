            <h3 id="about"> Hello, I am Charlotte, a graphic designer and artist located in Cambridge MA.<br> I am a certified granite stater, tea enthusiast, and lover of movies so bad that <br>they are good. As a designer my passion is for print and publication. However,<br> I dabble in brand development, web design, and UX. I spend my time away <br>from screens in the nearest pottery studio or getting lost in the wilderness. </h3> 
          <ul>
    <li>My favorite food is, but not limited to, oatmeal cookies exclusively made loosely following my great grandmother's recipe while listening to soft jazz. </li>  
    <li>My favorite places to find inspiration are my sketch books, local museums, and the design books passed down from my fathers, neighbor's late husband. </li>  
    <li>My favorite place is my close friend's couch but only when her cat, Baboo, is on it too.</li>
